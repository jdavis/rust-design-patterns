Design Principles
=================

from Head First Design Patterns.

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from
   what stays the same.

2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.

3. Favor composition over inheritance.

4. Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
